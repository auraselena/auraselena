### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm Selena Aura, and I'm passionate about web development. This GitHub profile serves as an overview of my work, projects, and contributions.
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently not working yet.
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently delve into full-stack development using JavaScript, React, and Express.js.
In the future, I hope I can expand my skills to be a mobile developer. Wish me luck!

## About Me

I'm a Bachelor of Mathematics from Brawijaya University. My interest in technology grew since I was in my 4th year of college. After graduating, I pursued the web-dev skills by myself through YouTube channels, and joining a bootcamp program in Purwadhika Digital Technology School.


Feel free to explore the repositories and projects listed here, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or collaboration opportunities! I'm excited to connect with fellow developers and learn from the community.
