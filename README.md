## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!<br><br>
I'm ✨Selena Aura✨, a full-stack developer based in Bandung, Indonesia. This GitHub profile serves as overview of my projects, track of my works and contributions.<br>
🌱 I currently delve into full-stack development using JavaScript, React, and Express.js.<br>
In the next two years, I hope I can deepen my webdev skills, and learn mobile development after. Wish me luck on my learning journey!
