## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!<br><br>
I'm ✨Selena Aura✨, a full-stack developer based in Bandung, Indonesia. This GitHub profile serves as overview of my projects, track of my works and contributions.<br>
🌱 I currently delve into full-stack development using JavaScript, React, and Express.js.<br>
In the next two years, I hope I can deepen my webdev skills, and learn mobile development after. Wish me luck on my learning journey!

## About Me

I'm a Bachelor of Mathematics from Brawijaya University. My interest in technology grew since I was in my 4th year of college. After graduating, I pursued the web-dev skills by myself through YouTube channels, and joining a bootcamp program in Purwadhika Digital Technology School.


Feel free to explore the repositories and projects listed here, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or collaboration opportunities! I'm excited to connect with fellow developers and learn from the community.<br><br>
